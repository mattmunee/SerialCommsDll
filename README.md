# SerialCommsDll
Basic DLL for Serial Communications

The .vcxproj (tested in VS2010) is included for easy startup.

Build the project using a batch build to create all configurations.  The resulting .dll and .pdb files are placed in a newly-created folder "\SerialCommsDll\bin\$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\".  Similarly, the .lib files are placed in a newly-created folder "\SerialCommsDll\lib\$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\".
